    # --- Topics ---
    scan_topic: "/scan"
    odom_topic: "/odom"
    drive_topic: "/disparity/drive"  # Disparity's drive command (used by map_control when use_disparity=true)

    # --- Vehicle Parameters ---
    wheel_base: 0.324          # Distance between front and rear axles (m)
    car_half_width: 0.15      # Half of car width for safety margin (m)

    # --- Disparity Parameters ---
    max_range: 10.0           # Maximum LiDAR range to consider (m)
    disparity_threshold: 1.0  # Minimum disparity to consider as gap (m)
    margin: 1.0               # Safety margin added to car half width (m)

    # --- Control Parameters ---
    max_speed: 6.0            # Maximum driving speed (m/s)
    min_speed: 3.0            # Minimum driving speed (m/s)
    max_steering_angle: 0.4   # Maximum steering angle (radians, ~23 degrees)

    # --- Pure Pursuit Parameters ---
    # Lookahead distance calculation: Ld = q_ld + m_ld * speed
    # Then clipped: Ld = clip(Ld, ld_min, ld_max)
    ld_min: 1.0               # Minimum lookahead distance (m)
    ld_max: 5.0               # Maximum lookahead distance (m)
    m_ld: 0.6                 # Lookahead slope (distance per m/s of speed)
    q_ld: 0.2                 # Lookahead offset (base distance in m)

    # --- Smoothing ---
    steering_alpha: 0.7       # Steering smoothing factor (0-1, higher = less smoothing)

    # --- Visualization ---
    marker_frame_id: "laser"  # Frame for visualization markers (real hardware uses "laser")
    publish_markers: true     # Enable/disable marker publishing
